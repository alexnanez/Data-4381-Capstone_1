# Detecting Online Transaction Fraud via Machine Learning

* **This repository holds an attempt at apply machine learning algorithms to detect fraud in an online transaction dataset from the IEEE-CIS Fraud Kaggle challenge (
the Store Sales - Time Series Forecasting Kaggle challenge ([https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/store-sales-time-series-forecasting](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ieee-fraud-detection)).**

## Overview

* The task was to use the features in the transaction and identity datasets to predict if an online transaction is fraudulent.
